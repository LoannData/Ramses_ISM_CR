This file is a summary of (all ?) the new variables that have been added in the RNIMHD (radiation non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics!) version of RAMSES.
Currently, NVAR must be 12: 8 classic RAMSES variable (d,u,v,w,P,Bx,By,Z) plus thermal energy and three variables to store the current (cell-centered).

&RUN_PARAMS:
- FLD (=.false. by default): logical to activate Flux Limited Diffusion for RHD. Note that if barotrop is set to true in the namelist PHYSICS_PARAMS block, then FLD is automatically turned off. 
- clumpfind : logical to enable clumfinder algorithm (Bleuler $ Teyssier 2014). It can be used to create sink particles (sink should be activated in this block). It runs a clumpfinder algorithm on the fly and writes clump properties in the output directory. 
* Note that if clumpfind is enabled, sink cannot be formed using the alafederrath mode.
- alafederrath : logical to enable sink creation following the Federrath et al. (2010) paper. Conflicts with clumpfind
- nsinkbody (=.false. by default): uses a direct N-body integrator for the sink-sink interaction and a direct summation for the gas-sink interaction. By default a CIC is used, where the sink mass is spread over the sink radius (poisson equation is then solved to get the global gravitational potential). The sink radius equals 4*dxmin (ir_cloud=4 im pm_parameters). Otherwise, it uses the CIC, but 'pic' has to be activated. See patch/core/nml/coeur_rhd_sink.nml for instance.
- tracer (=.false. by default): logical to enable tracer particles. Needs an input file with tracer particle positions (see ic_part file in patch/rhd/lib). By default, density, gas temperature and radiation temperature are stored for each tracer particle (added extinction as a stored quantitiy).
- extinction (=.false. by default): use the column density estimator of Valdivia & Hennebelle (2014). WARNING, NEXTINCT should be 1 in Makefile or in hydro_parameters.f90. Sotered in uold(8+nrad+nextinct). Note that the visual extincion is stored, not the column density. 
- DTU (=.false. by default):Unique time-step activated for niMHD diffusion routines. It works for Ohmic diffusion only. NO SUBCYCLING!!!
- radiative_nimhdheating (=.false. by default): add the Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion heating terms as source terms in the radiative energy equation in FLD=.true.. Toherwise, it is added 

&INIT_PARAMS:
- add a E_region to enable initial set up from the namelist for the radiative energy (valid only for grey radiative transfer...). If you want to use it, modify init_flow_fine accordingly.

In the core directory, the following variables have been added:
- mass_c (=1 by default): mass of the initial dense core in solar masses.
- rap (=1 by default):  initial aspect ratio of the dense core.
- cont (=1 by default): initial density contrast between the center and the border of the dense core. If cont .ne. 1, then the dense core is set up such that the density profiles show a plateau at the center and then decreases as r^-2. The contrast between the border of the core and the intercloud medium is set to 10 in condinit.f90 (cont_ic).
- ff_sct (=1 by default): freefall time / sound crossing time
- ff_rt (=1 by default): freefall time / rotation time
- ff_act(=1 by default): freefall time / Alfven crossing time
- ff_vct(=1 by default): freefall time / Vrms crossing time. Needs here a file containing the velocity perturbation (init_turb.data, in patch/rhd/core/lib). 
- theta_mag (=0 by default): angle between magnetic field and rotation axis (in degree).

- bb_test (=.false. by default): logical to activate Boss & Bodenheimer initial conditions (uniform density and temperature, solid body rotation). The next variable are used for BB test only. The ff_sct, ff_vct, ff_rt, ff_act, rap, cont variables are ineffective.
	- alpha (=0.5 by default): initial ratio between thermal and gravitational energies
  	- beta (=0 by default): initial ratio between rotational and gravitational energies
  	- delta_rho (=0 by default): amplitude of the initial m=2 density perturbation
  	- crit (=0 by default): inverse of the mu parameter for magnetic field (crit=0.5 for mu=2)
  	- Mach (=0 by default): initial turbulent mach number. If different from 0, it needs here a file containing the velocity perturbation (init_turb.data, in patch/rhd/core/lib)
 	- contrast (=100 by default): initial density contrast between the dense core and the ambient medium (isolated conditions)


&REFINE_PARAMS:
- iso_jeans (.false. by default): activate isothermal sound speed Jeans length refinement criterion. It is activated if the gas temperature is greater than Tp_jeans. 
- Tp_jeans (=10. by default): temperature to activate isothermal sound speed Jeans length refinement criterion. It is used up to density rho_sio=1.d-8 (by default, hard-coded in hydro_flag.f90), then it relaxes to a normal jeans criterion.

- floor_E (=1.d-10 by default): Radiative energy floor value to compute err_grad_E

&BOUNDARY_PARAMS:

- T_bound (=0 by default): to set boundary conditions for the temperature. It is used to initialise the radiative energy (radiation_source(t_bound)).

&PHYSICS_PARAMS:
- barotrop (=.false. by default): activate the barotrop EOS. If barotrop is activated, FLD should be off and NVAR=12 (11+1 for internal energy). For the barotropic EOS, there are two options: it uses either a classic analytic law (default mode) or a fit from the Vaytet et al. (2013) 1D results.  (if analytical_barotrop=.false.)
- analytical_barotrop (=.true. by default): enables the use of the Vaytet et al. fit. If analytical_barotrop=.false., it needs to read the file ‘barotropic_eos.dat’ (in patch/rhd/core/lib). In core/cooling_fine.f90, function barotrop1D: barotrop1D = Tr_floor * ( 1.0d0 + (rhon/n_star)**(gamma-1.0d0) 
- n_star (=0.1 g/cc  by default): used by analytical_barotrop. Density at which the gas turns optically thick (typically 1e-13 g/cc in SF calculations). Note that it can conflict with the density threshold used to create star particle in larger scale calculations. The temperature is set by Tr_floor.
- eos (=.false. by default): if .true., it uses the tabulation of the Saumon-Chabrier EOS (needed for 2nd collapse). It then need the ‘tab_eos.dat’ file (in patch/rhd/core/lib). By default, a simple perfect gas relation is used.

- mu_gas (=1 in thd and 2.33 in rhd/core): gas mean molecular weight.
- clump_jeans (=.false. by default): do the clump finder only on cells that violate the Jeans length refinement criterion. It has not been tested and probably useless….
- merge_stars (=.true. by default): enable sink merge for sink younger that the first Larson core lifetime (larson_lifetime=5000! lifetime of first larson core in years). Accretion rate is not update for the merged sink to avoid violent energy input that makes the implicit solver crash.

- grav_softening_type_sink (=“spline” by default): same as grav_softening_type_gas for the sink-sink interaction. It is active only if nsinkbody=.true..
- sink_integrator (=“leapfrog” by default): sink move integrator scheme. “euler” of “leapfrog” can be used. It is active only if nsinkbody=.true..
- tstep_sink_factor (=0.01 by default): timestep safety factor for sink-sink integrator (sub cycling). It is active only if nsinkbody=.true..

- fcheck_vr (=0.1 by default): threshold for the radial velocity sink creation check in the alafederrath mode. It is in units of the local sound speed (v<fcheck_vr*cs).
amr_parameters).
- ncell_racc (=2.51 by default): accretion radius of the sink (Racc=ncell_racc*dx_min). Used only in the alafederrath mode. Otherwise, ncell_racc=ir_cloud (=4).

- freqs_in_Hz (=.true. by default): frequency units in Hz if true; if not eV
- Tr_floor (=10 by default): background radiation field temperature. It sets the imposed boundary conditions in the core patch, the initial dense core temperature and the temperature used in the barotropic case. SHOULD IT REMAINS as it is for the BCs ? - WARNING: it affects the pressure_fix in set_uold (minimum temperature of 0.3*tTr_floor).
- robin (=1 by default): weight of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition sat the coarse-to-fine interface. robin=1 corresponds to Dirichlet, robin=0 to Neumann (BC: robin*E0 + (1-robin)*F0). Use robin=1 unless you are aware of the potential crash to can occur otherwise (negative energy).
- min_optical_depth (=1.d-6 by default): set the minimum optical depth in the cell (it may accelerate convergence in optically thin regions).

- dt_control (=.false. by default): enable imposed timestep (dt=dtdiff_params(1)*dtdiff_params(2)**nstep_coarse in courant_fine.f90).

Variable specific to SF:
- opacity_type (='grey' by default): Vaytet et al. (2013) opacity table. It needs the file  'rhd/core/lib/vaytet_grey_opacities3D.bin'. 'multigroup' can also be used.

- PMS_evol (=.false. by default): PMS evolution subgrid model to compute the radiative feedback. By default, it uses a simple power-law which relates the mass of the protostar, the internal luminosity and the accretion luminosity (from Cox book).

I/ Note on the use of FLD and implicit solver

There are two radiative transfer routines. The old radiative_transfer_cg works for grey FLD and without any library. The new radiative_transfer_bicg (default) works for multigroup FLD abnd requires a link to the lapack library. 

WARNING: if radiative_transfer_bicg is used in the Makefile, then it requires LAPACK routines. If you wish not to use the lapapck library, replace radiative_transfer_bicg with radiative_transfer_cg in the Makefile.

NRAD in the Makefile gives the number of frequency groups that composes the radiation spectrum. Use 1 group for grey.


II/ Note on the use of sink particles
To be written…

There is the possibility of having periodic conditions for the sink-sink and sink-gas interaction in the nsinkbody mode (contact Benoit for information). 

1/ Sink creation
Modifications compared to the Bleuler et al. implementation:
	- add a check on the jeans density, i.e. the peak density cell above the density threshold used for clump finding must be Jeans unstable (dens_jeans_tot array)
	- modify checks of Bleuler: a sink is created on a clump if :	
			# it is contracting fast enough in all direction (e.g. t_cont < t_larson)
			#  Egrav + 2Eth <0 (Jeans unstable)
			# Total energy < 0 

2/ Radiative feedback


III/ Note on the use of non-ideal MHD
To be written…

Array resistivite_chimie: table for the resistivities. Allocated in read_hydro_params.f90. Needs the file res_sig.dat (output from Jacques chemistry code, function of density + barotrop). 
 
- xmion= mp*mu_ion of the most abundant ion (HCO+, mu_ion=29)


IV/ The Test Suite
DONE!
