cooling : 
take care two solve_cooling : 2 versions, one for RT and one without. 

Valeska's stuff moved in module_cooling_frig

cooling : the polytrope to limit the temperature floor must be handle with care. 
n_star a,d T_star must be checked carefully

units : scale_T2 is =1 in the new version


%%already in feedback_module
%%average.f90 : developed by Olivier. Used in feedback
%%%=> move it in feedback_module 

velocity_fine and its call from courant_fine and amr_step : not imported for now. May be put them onto the patch.


powerlaw.f90 : developped by Olivier to decide mass of massive stars
=> move it in stellar_particle


#not useful
#lookuptable.f90 : Sam's stuff to interpolate tables
#=> moved

rt_parameters.f90 
=> moved

write_cooling : Sam's stuff to debug cooling. Not necessary for now.
=> not moved yet


pm_commons.f90:
=> moved from ../../../pm
report the changed (except acc_rate and acc_lum)


init_stellar stellar_particle output_stellar : Olivier's stuff to follow massive stars and tehir feedback
=> moved
=> check all variables have been initialed (Sam had problems)      PENDING
output_stellar must be added in output_amr                    
read_stellar_param must be added in read_param               
make_stellar must be added to amr_step                       


init_part : moved from ../../../pm 
then added : call init_stellar , use feedback_module


feedback_module : imported
read_feedback_params must be added in  read_param  
make_sn_stellar must be added in amr_step	    


sink_RT_feedback : moved
add its call in amr_step                            
note there is now a radiative_feedback_sink in sink_particle


 
init_sink : 
copy the ../../../pm file
and report the changes                              ok some functionalities to be reactivated


output_sink : 
copy the ../../../pm file
and report the changes                              ok some functionalities to be reactivated

 
sink_particle : 
copy the ../../../pm file
and report the changes                              PENDING



poisson_parameter.f90 : only useful to get trelax not done for now


newdt_fine.dt : used for the wind
copied from pm and changes reported


hydro_flags : does not seem to be required, do it later
=> not moved yet


cloud_module :check variable compatibilities        PENDING
and determine whether should be used



problem during compilation : 

year in feedback_module also exist in hydro_parameter
year (feedback_module) => year2
